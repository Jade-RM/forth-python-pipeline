I created this project in order to make a cross-language data pipeline between a low-level and a high level language.
Forth generates a sequence of numbers and prints them.
Python analyses these numbers and prints out some basic statistics about them.
It was created and runs entirely on Termux (Android). It is possible to run the programme on any Linux terminal using Gforth and Python.
The data pipeline is bundled and runs in a shell script using the command run-forthpy.

The programme itself is very simple at this point, but it can be expanded.
